## 1. Project Overview
This project implements Bayesian regression analysis on customer data to understand and predict customer behavior patterns. The analysis includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and Bayesian modeling to provide probabilistic insights into customer purchase patterns.

## 1.1 Project Structure
- `aaa.ipynb`: Main Jupyter notebook containing the Bayesian regression analysis
- `original_dataset.csv`: Raw customer data
- `cleaned_dataset.csv`: Processed and cleaned dataset
- `bayesian_regression_trace.png`: Visualization of the Bayesian regression results
- `requirements.txt`: Python package dependencies
- `environment.yml`: Conda environment configuration

## 1.2 Features
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory data analysis
- Bayesian regression modeling
- Visualization of regression results
- Customer behavior analysis

## 1.3 Dependencies
The project requires the following Python packages:
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- pymc3
- scikit-learn

## 1.4 Installation
1. Clone the repository
2. Create a conda environment using the provided `environment.yml`:
   ```bash
   conda env create -f environment.yml
   ```
3. Activate the environment:
   ```bash
   conda activate bayesian_regression
   ```

## 1.5 Usage
1. Open the Jupyter notebook `aaa.ipynb`
2. Run the cells in sequence to:
   - Load and clean the data
   - Perform exploratory analysis
   - Build and run the Bayesian regression model
   - Visualize the results

## 1.6 Results
The project generates:
- Cleaned and processed dataset
- Bayesian regression model parameters
- Visualizations of the regression analysis
- Insights into customer behavior patterns

## 1.7 Contributing
