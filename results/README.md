This directory contains the output files and visualizations generated from the Bayesian Regression analysis.

# 1. Output Files

## 1.1 Visualizations

### 1.1.1 feature_importance.png
- Shows the relative importance of each feature in the model
- Displays posterior distributions of feature coefficients
- Helps identify the most influential predictors

### 1.1.2 trace_plot.png
- Visualizes the MCMC sampling process
- Shows the convergence of model parameters
- Helps assess the quality of the sampling

### 1.1.3 posterior_distributions.png
- Displays the posterior distributions of model parameters
- Shows uncertainty in parameter estimates
- Includes credible intervals and point estimates

# 2. File Generation
These files are automatically generated when running the analysis pipeline:
1. The main script (`src/main.py`) generates these visualizations
2. Files are saved in PNG format for easy viewing
3. Each visualization is created using appropriate statistical plotting libraries

# 3. Interpretation
- All visualizations should be interpreted in the context of the Bayesian framework
- Uncertainty estimates are crucial for proper interpretation
- Results should be compared against business objectives and domain knowledge

# 4. Version Control
- Results are regenerated each time the analysis is run
- Historical results should be archived if needed for comparison
- The `.gitkeep` file ensures the directory structure is maintained in version control
